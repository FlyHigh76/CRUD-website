# CRUD-website
A re-implementation of a tutorial on building a CRUD website with the MERN stack with functional components. The original tutorial was built using object-oriented components. The link to the original tutorial is https://codingthesmartway.com/the-mern-stack-tutorial-building-a-react-crud-application-from-start-to-finish-part-1/
The editing feature is still in-progress since I haven't found the time to do it yet.
